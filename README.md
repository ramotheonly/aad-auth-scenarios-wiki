# aad-auth-scenarios-wiki

I will be listing out the various use case scenarios for Azure Active Directory, referred to as AAD throughout this repo and related repositories. I'll be building it out from most to less prominently used cases. Hopefully, with easily reusable and integratable pieces of code and configuration in different programming languages, frameworks and existing applications. Idea is to fully reuse the existing work shared by other wonderful folks of our developer community create an easy path for their induction into existing works that the readers are working on.
